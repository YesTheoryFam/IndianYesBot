## Is that it?

Well, of course not. The Yesbot is constantly being updated and will constantly be improved.

## Can I contribute?

Yes, certainly. In order for new born programmers to learn and contribute, the code is written in a very simple format.

Once you've gone through the code and ready to contribute, or even if it's just a suggestion, ping one of the moderators on the server with the @support tag and let them know that you want to contribute.

## Can I fork this code and deploy my bot?

Some of this bot's features are server specific so you shouldn't be expecting it to work the same way as it works on the Yes Fam India Server. But you can take inspirations from this repo.
