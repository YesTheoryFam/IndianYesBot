## Can I contribute?
Yes, certainly. The code is written in a very simple format, in order, to welcome new born coders to understand and contribute.

Once you've gone through the code and ready to contribute, ping one of the moderators on the server with the @support tag and let them know that you want to contribute.

## Can I fork and deploy this code for my bot?
Some of this bot's feature are server specific so you shouldn't be expecting it to work the same way as it works on the Yes Fam India Server. But you are free to take inspirations from this repo.
